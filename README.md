## How to play
First, install the datapack by downloading the zip and placing it inside the datapacks folder.

To play you just need to place the lobby structure by running the command `/place template trials:new_spawn ~ ~-1 ~`. Once placed you can just enter the building, select between Teams and Co-op and press the `Start Game` button.
